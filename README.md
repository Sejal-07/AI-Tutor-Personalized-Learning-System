## 📈 Weak Skills Detection

The system detects weak skills using a hybrid approach combining statistics and machine learning.

### Concept Mastery Score (0–100)
- Accuracy & Response Efficiency
- Trend Prediction (improving / declining)

### Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression (mastery classification)
- Linear Regression (trend prediction)
- Rule-based thresholds for prioritization

### Skill Priority
- **High:** Mastery < 50 or declining trend
- **Medium:** Mastery 50–65
- **Strong:** Mastery > 65
---
## 🎯 Recommendation System
A hybrid recommendation strategy is used:
- Content-Based Filtering – Weak concepts → relevant resources
- Collaborative Filtering – Resources successful for similar students
- Rule-Based Logic – Prerequisites and learning style matching
